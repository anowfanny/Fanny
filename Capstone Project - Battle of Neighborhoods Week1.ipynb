A dataset consisting of the crime statistics of each Neighborhood in Vancouver along with type of crime, recorded year, month and hour.\n2. Borough information is used to map the existing data where each neighborhood can be assigned with the right borough.\n3. This data is fetched using OpenCage Geocoder to find the safest borough, explore the neighborhood by plotting it on maps using Folium, and perform exploratory data analysis.\n4.
